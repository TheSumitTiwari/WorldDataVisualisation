The CytoscapeGraph Component is a React-based graph visualization module built using cytoscape.js and react-cytoscapejs. It allows users to:
	•	Pass a dataset containing nodes and edges dynamically.
	•	Render an interactive graph with multiple layouts (e.g., Euler, Grid, Breadth-first).
	•	Click on nodes to display detailed metadata, aiding in deeper analysis.
	•	Configure styling, zoom levels, and layouts based on team requirements.
	•	Integrate seamlessly into various applications, dashboards, or analytics tools.

By making this component modular and configurable, teams across the organization can leverage the same core visualization engine while customizing it for their specific needs. This reduces redundancy, improves maintainability, and enhances cross-team collaboration.



Benefits of the Reusable CytoscapeGraph Component
	1.	Standardized Graph Visualization Across Teams
	•	Provides a consistent way to visualize complex networks for different use cases.
	•	Eliminates the need for teams to build custom graph solutions from scratch.
	2.	Configurable and Extensible
	•	Supports dynamic data input, custom node styles, and various layout options.
	•	Can be extended with additional features like filtering, search, and real-time updates.
	3.	Improved Decision-Making and Analysis
	•	Enables teams to interactively explore relationships, dependencies, and impact areas.
	•	Helps in identifying bottlenecks, risks, and optimization opportunities.
	4.	Seamless Integration
	•	Can be embedded into dashboards, analytics tools, or internal applications.
	•	Works with different data sources (APIs, databases, JSON files, etc.).
	5.	Enhanced User Experience
	•	Provides intuitive interaction with zoom, pan, and node click functionalities.
	•	Improves readability and navigation of large datasets.
	6.	Reduces Development Effort and Costs
	•	Saves engineering time by offering a ready-to-use visualization component.
	•	Reduces maintenance overhead by centralizing graph visualization logic.
	7.	Cross-Team Collaboration
	•	Enables different departments (engineering, infrastructure, business, risk, etc.) to leverage the same visualization tool.
	•	Promotes knowledge sharing and a unified approach to data representation.
	8.	Scalable and Performance Optimized
	•	Supports large graphs with thousands of nodes and edges efficiently.
	•	Uses Cytoscape’s performance optimizations for smooth rendering and interaction.
	9.	Future-Proof and Technology-Agnostic
	•	Can be enhanced with new features like AI-based insights, predictive analytics, or real-time monitoring.
	•	Works with modern frontend technologies and can be adapted for different frameworks if needed.

By implementing this component, the organization can standardize network visualization, reduce redundancy, and enhance decision-making capabilities across multiple teams.

Setting up unit testing and code coverage in Angular apps is often inconsistent, time-consuming, and tied to outdated tools like Karma + Jasmine, leading to poor testing practices and low coverage.

Description
It is a reusable standalone Angular component template pre-configured with Jest for modern unit testing and automatic code coverage report generation. It replaces the traditional Karma-Jasmine setup with a faster, cleaner, and more scalable approach using Testing Library and Jest-DOM. This solution streamlines the testing workflow, encourages test-driven development (TDD), and ensures higher code quality across Angular projects. By integrating testing from the start, it saves setup time, improves team consistency, and supports CI/CD environments effortlessly.

Benifits:
Benefits
- Faster Test Execution: Uses Jest's Node-based runner, eliminating slow browser-based tests.
- Reusable Template: Can be easily integrated into any Angular project for consistent test setup.
- Built-in Code Coverage: Automatically generates detailed coverage reports with a single command.
- Encourages TDD: Promotes writing tests alongside development, improving reliability.
- Standalone Component Structure: Aligns with modern Angular architecture best practices.
- CI/CD Ready: Easily integrates with pipelines for automated test and coverage reporting.
- Cleaner Test Syntax: Uses Testing Library for more readable, maintainable tests.
- Team Standardization: Unifies testing practices across developers and projects.
